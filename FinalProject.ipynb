    "Our research question is \"How does the type of business affect the type of police stops around different business types?\". For our first analysis, the effect of the business is measured by determining the three closest crimes that occur at the business. These three crimes are considered to be directly influenced by the type of business in this analysis. The three closest crimes were chosen in order to prevent variability and outliers as well as providing a larger picture for each business type. For our second analysis, the measure of how much a business affects the type of police stops is defined by the number of police stops that occur within a 0.5km radius (Note: the distance can be changed within the code to determine the correlation at different distances). 0.5km was chosen due to 0.5km being about the size of one block."

    "Through an interactive map provided by the San Diego Union Tribune, we searched for battery, alcohol, drug related crimes as they were the most frequent crimes reported <b>(1)</b>. We found that these three crimes had a strong connection to particular communities, such as Pacific Beach, Downtown San Diego, and Hillcrest. We wanted to investigate why there were high concentration of crime reports in this community, and found a l 2014 report from the University of Virginia explaining how pawn shops encouraged theft-related crimes. According to the report, experts explained that pawn shops in the premises increases the likelihood for a theft-related crime in the community since people in poverty see pawn shops as stores that help facilitate a market for stolen items <b>(2)</b>.  Police authorities have noticed the trend and began to work closely with pawns shop owners to arrest criminals selling stolen goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the more we searched location-crime related reports, the more we began to question whether or not businesses could attract crimes into the community. Our curiosity led us to a study done by the Center of Disease and Control Prevention which investigated tobacco and alcohol shops indirectly promoting crime in the Los Angeles area. According to the report, South Central Los Angeles had a significant amount of violent and property crime within a measured distance from these types of businesses <b>(3)</b>. Furthermore, another report performed in the Sacramento area explained that residents living close by alcohol stores had a stronger tendency to return back to purchase more alcohol, which led those individuals become arrested due public intoxications and disruptive behavior <b>(4)</b>.\n",
    " For this project, we decided to investigate battery and alcohol related crimes due to the frequency of reported cases, and research possible types of businesses attracting  these crime in the San Diego area.\n",

    "From our background research we predict that a correlation exists between stops relating to alcohol, drugs, and physical altercations and alchohol related businesses. We believe this outcome will be correct based on previous research done on the correlation of alcohol and arrests. Additionally, we believe that police tend to frequent areas that have a larger number of potentially dangerous conflicts, which are frequent at businesses that provid alcohol as seen above in our research. Because more police activity exists in these areas, the likelihood of being stopped by police in these areas are higher."

A fight happens more often in bars than in offices, a gun is more likely to be found by a shooting range, a car stealing is more likely to be reflected by wealth of surroundings.  \n",

    "It is very time consuming to get distance based on latitude and longitude because this is not Euclidean distance and both latitude & longitude are not straight lines.  \n",
    "Based on this, I used a threshold to judge wether this point is likely to be closest point or not. This simple method works really well, ruling about 99% points out and, with the help of tuple calculaiton, pushing the speed of one iteration from **7 second** to **20 ms**"
